You have found the (somewhat) hidden Behind The Scenes file!

First, a little backstory. Jastian Summer was originally the name of an Alien Swarm total conversion mod I was making with some friends nearly twelve years ago. There honestly wasn't a lot to it. We had a few ideas, but nowhere near enough to actually make a game out of.

Since then, I've worked on multiple Alien Swarm mod teams (Hypovolemia, Swarm Director 2) before settling on Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop as essentially an unpaid full time job. The name Jastian Summer (Jastian being the name of the star my first Spore planet was orbiting around) has followed me around since then, becoming the name of one of my Guild Wars 2 characters, and now the name of this campaign.

As for the other names in the campaign:

- Tharsis is the name of a Warframe Mobile Defense mission on Mars, and also the name of a volcanic plateau on real-life Mars.

- Deepcore (and the number 32 used extensively in the mission) are from Deep Rock Galactic's Update 32 patch notes, Roughnecks at Work, the update that added Onsite Refining missions. Deepcore is part of the name of one of the default guns in Deep Rock Galactic.

- Rata Terebro is based on the Guild Wars 2 tradition of naming Asura cities in Latin (translating literally to "boring thought", but not the kind of "boring" you're probably thinking of from those two words together). Like Rata Sum and Rata Novus, this is also an anagram, of "bore, retreat".

- Cholistan is the name of a Warframe Excavation mission on Europa, and also the name of a desert in real-life Pakistan.

- Inquest Obelisk comes from the Guild Wars 2 antagonist organization named The Inquest and a classification of Warframe Corpus ships, Obelisk.

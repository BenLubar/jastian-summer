# Campaign

## Tharsis Outpost

`Mechanically: Marines need to defend the Tech marine as he hacks three consoles along a path. Between the second and third consoles, there is a canyon, which can either be traversed on foot or via a noisy moving platform. This choice affects the type of enemies encountered.`

## Deepcore Refinery

`Mechanically: Marines need to set up, activate, and defend a large machine with many pipes that refines fuel. Small repairs can be done by any marine, but if the machine takes too much damage, a Tech is required to reset it.`

## Rata Terebro

`Mechanically: Marines assemble a very large gun, then use it to blast a hole in the cavern wall, allowing access to the next mission.`

## Cholistan Winter

`Mechanically: Marines defend a slowly-moving fuel transport vehicle until it reaches the launch site, then defend the rocket until it is ready to launch. Mission ends with the marines entering the rocket.`

## Inquest Obelisk

`Mechanically: Marines must disable safety precautions inside an autonomous space station in order to make a machine that is inadvertently helping the aliens vulnerable to attack. Going outside, even in power armor, causes severe radiation burns. One of the four sides of the space station has a huge hole in it.`

# Standalone Missions

## Tharsis Holdout

`Mechanically: Marines need to defend a stationary target from waves of aliens while a non-player character prepares to extract the target. There are a total of 10 waves. Mission success is when all 10 waves have been defeated.`

## Cholistan Excavation

`Mechanically: Marines need to activate, power, and defend machines that extract a valuable chemical from the ground. Supplies are delivered for successful extraction. Difficulty increases over time. Marines must leave before they are fully overwhelmed by aliens.`

## Inquest Survival

`Mechanically: Marines need to keep a "life support" meter above zero for as long as possible, and once it hits zero, they need to get to the extraction point before they die. Supplies are delivered based on a timer. Difficulty increases over time.`
